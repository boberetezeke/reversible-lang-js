      Programming the computer is not that hard. The computer is a very
      simple minded instruction executor. To program a computer, you have
      to tell it exactly what to do, taking into mind anything that could
      go wrong. Also, a computer can only do a simple set of things and
      so you need to build up what the computer from its simple building blocks,
      like legos, into more and more complicated building blocks until 
      it does what you need it to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      To demonstrate programming, we are going to use a very simple 
      programming language (which I'll call <strong>simply</strong>) that 
      only does a very few things. You can however
      watch it execute in your browser so that you can see how a computer
      program functions visually. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At a very basic level, a program is written in a special "language" 
      which exactly describes what the computer is to do next. It is like a
      recipe, except that there is not ambiguity in the instructions. The
      computer will follow the steps whether they make sense to do them
      or not.  A program takes some input, uses its memory to transform 
      that and then produces some output.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input can consist of keypresses on the keyboard, mouse clicks or
      mouse movements, touches on a phone, or tablet, or even sensor readings
      from the computer's sensors like GPS or the accelorometer. The program
      then reacts to those inputs and produces something from them. What
      it produces is called the output. The output could consist of drawing
      something on the screen, playing a sound, causing a vibration, sending
      some data to the internet to allow other people to access that data, or
      storing some data on your computer, phone or tablet so that you can 
      access it later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <strong>simply</strong> you can get input from the user,
      store it in the computer's memory, perform calculations on it,
      and then output some results. You enter your programs in a simple
      text box on the screen with one statement per line and when you are
      done entering your program you click the run button. When you click the
      run button, the computer will check to see if the program that you
      entered is valid and if not, it will show you on what line you made a
      mistake and how you might correct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>simply</strong> there is a syntax or grammer to follow in
      order for the language to make sense. Just like in your language that
      you speak, there is a right way and a wrong way to express things, in
      <strong>simply</strong> there is a right way and wrong way to write
      a correct program. The program will not run unless it has the correct
      grammer. Below I will indicate the grammer that is allowed in 
      <strong>simply</strong> programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>simply</strong>, each line is called a statement and there
      are two kinds of statements allowed. One is to request the computer to
      store a value in its memory and one is a  command to the computer
      to perform a function. First I will show you how to store information
      in memory.
    </p>
    <h3>Storing information to memory</h3>
    <p>
      To store information in memory you store it associated with a name.
      The grammer for this is:
      <pre class="code">
      name = value
      </pre>
      where the name is the name in memory that you are associating the value
      with. To start with, we are only going to use values that are numbers.
      The name can consist of upper and lower case letters and underscore 
      characters. After the name should follow at least one space, the equal
      sign and then at least one space and finally the numeric value.
